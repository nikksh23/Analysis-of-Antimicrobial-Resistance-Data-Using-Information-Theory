# Superinformation Analysis
This folder contains the R script used to perform superinformation analysis on genomic sequences related to antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Superinformation is a higher-order entropy-based measure that captures nonlinear, multi-variable dependencies in sequence data—extending beyond pairwise correlations to reveal complex patterns potentially linked to resistance mechanisms.

## Purpose
Identify subtle genomic variations that may underlie the evolution of antimicrobial resistance.
Provide complementary insights to gene expression–based analysis.

## Prerequisites
Before running the script, ensure the following R library is installed:
- library(tidyverse)

## Contents
- superinfo.r – Core script for computing superinformation on genomic datasets
