# Analysis of Antimicrobial Resistance Data Using Information Theory

This repository contains the complete workflow, analysis scripts, and models for studying Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) using information-theoretic methods. The project integrates entropy-based gene expression analysis, feature selection through mutual information, and machine learning to enable robust prediction of resistance profiles.
Developed as part of an academic research project, this framework is designed to be both scalable and interpretable, especially in settings where classical statistical assumptions‚Äîlike defined control groups‚Äîdo not hold.

## Key Features
### Entropy-Based Differential Gene Expression (DGE):
Identifies differentially expressed genes using Weighted Relative Entropy (WRE)‚Äîworks with or without defined test/control groups.

### Mutual Information & Jensen-Shannon Distance:
Quantifies non-linear dependencies and distributional differences between resistance profiles.

### Multivariate Mutual Information (MMI):
Selects non-redundant, high-information features for efficient AMR prediction.

### Machine Learning with XGBoost:
Predicts AMR expression profiles using minimal feature sets with performance close to full models.

### Superinformation (Experimental):
Applies higher-order entropy to genomic sequences to identify complex resistance patterns beyond pairwise relationships.
